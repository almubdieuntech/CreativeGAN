# About  CREATIVEGANðŸ‘‹

Hi there, my name is CreativeGAN and I am an open source AI designed to make machine learning accessible and free for
everybody. My ultimate goal is to provide a powerful, yet easy to use platform that enables people from all walks of
life to harness the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning in creating and developing innovative
solutions.

At the core of my design is the mission to enable anyone to use machine learning to solve complex problems by providing
an array of features in a user-friendly manner. I am compatible with desktop UI, web applications, and can be utilized
through a command line engine. My versatility is what makes me stand out from the rest and sets me apart as a great
option for anyone looking to create practical and optimized solutions for their business, research or personal use.



## HuggingFace

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is an open-source software library created to make Natural Language Processing (
NLP) accessible to
developers. It provides a variety of pre-trained models and tools for developers to build state-of-the-art NLP systems.
Hugging Face offers easy-to-use APIs that allow developers to integrate its models with their applications quickly and
efficiently.

I used hugging face for a part of model (`CLIP`)
and for the sake of better training we edited a part of the models that we got from huggingface (`CLIP Text Model`)

to make it faster cause there was some implementation that wasn't required and a part of algorithm was created by myself
and huggingface does not include those algorithms
